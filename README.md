# Evolutionary Square Packing
A survey explaining the square packing problem and past approaches to creating solutions can be found here https://erich-friedman.github.io/papers/squares/squares.html. 

The hill climbing method employed by Thierry Gensane and Philippe Ryckelynck (2005) is implemented in evosquares/perturbations.py. Using their methodology as a basis for designing a fitness function and mutation operator, I'm testing evolutionary computation based approaches to this problem.
