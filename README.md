# Evolutionary Square Packing
"Squares in squares" is a geometric packing problem in which some number of squares is arranged to minimize the size of the smallest bounding square that can contain them. A survey explaining the problem in greater detail and displaying some specific solutions can be found here https://erich-friedman.github.io/papers/squares/squares.html. 

A hill climbing method developed by Thierry Gensane and Philippe Ryckelynck (2005) (which is, to our knowledge, the only succesful computational approach to the problem that has been published) is implemented in evosquares/perturbations.py. We aim to create new computational methods to tackle the problem using approaches from the field of evolutionary computation.
