# Evolutionary Square Packing
"Squares in squares" is a geometric packing problem in which some number of squares is arranged to minimize the size of the smallest bounding square that can contain them. A survey explaining the problem in greater detail and displaying some specific solutions can be found here https://erich-friedman.github.io/papers/squares/squares.html. 

A hill climbing method developed by Thierry Gensane and Philippe Ryckelynck (2005) is implemented in evosquares/perturbations.py. We aim to create new methods to tackle the problem based on approaches from evolutionary computation.
